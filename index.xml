JMT-Services is a contractor/job management tool I developed for fun. It&amp;rsquo;s built with a bunch of nifty technologies that you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Thymeleaf, Keycloak, Bootstrap, and WebFlux. The idea was to create something that could handle the ups and downs of job management demands. With WebFlux, it&amp;rsquo;s as responsive as they come, scaling smoothly and swiftly. The whole thing runs in containers on GCP, making deployment a breeze, especially with a CI/CD pipeline managed through GitHub Actions.</description></item><item><title>Project List</title><link>https://jadenstittsworth.com/posts/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jadenstittsworth.com/posts/projects/</guid><description> JMT</description></item></channel></rss>
