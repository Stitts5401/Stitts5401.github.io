# a summary about you
summary: "Currently, I’m working as a full-time contractor at PNC bank. In my time so far I’ve been able to use my skills to introduce an automation framework into both of my projects. Most notably I learned and actively work with a few new tools to develop my projects. Spring Boot and Java Swing. I’m now comfortable enough to consider myself a Full-Stack Java Developer. I've designed and developed many DD, BD, and hybrid framework test scripts for Front-End and Back-End projects. My primary languages are Java, Gherkin, and SQL. However, I also work with JSON, Html, and XML frequently. I have a strong work ethic. I am a team player and I’m always cheerful and eager to learn new things and grow as a professional. I still have much to learn but I’m always open to new opportunities to grow as a developer!"
