It\u0026rsquo;s built with a bunch of nifty technologies that you\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard of: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Thymeleaf, Keycloak, Bootstrap, and WebFlux.

Sure, it might be a bit overkill for a project like this, but it\u0026rsquo;s all part of the learning experience. Plus, it\u0026rsquo;s always fun to see just how far you can push the tech, right?
